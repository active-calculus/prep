			<p>
				We want to determine the distance between two points <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> that are directly across from one another on opposite sides of a river, as pictured in <xref ref="F-right-act-river">Figure</xref>.
      			We mark the locations of those points and walk <m>50</m> meters downstream from <m>B</m> to point <m>P</m>
      			and use a sextant to measure <m>\angle BPA</m>.  If the measure of <m>\angle BPA</m> is <m>56.4^{\circ}</m>, how wide is the river?
      			What other information about the situation can you determine?
