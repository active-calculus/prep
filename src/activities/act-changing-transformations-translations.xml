						 On the same axes as the plot of <m>y = r(x)</m>, sketch the following graphs:  <m>y = g(x) = r(x) + 2</m>, <m>y = h(x) = r(x+1)</m>, and <m>y = f(x) = r(x+1) + 2</m>.  Be sure to label the point on each of <m>g</m>, <m>h</m>, and <m>f</m> that corresponds to <m>(-2,-1)</m> on the original graph of <m>r</m>.  In addition, write one sentence to explain the overall transformations that have resulted in <m>g</m>, <m>h</m>, and <m>f</m>.

						Is it possible to view the function <m>f</m> in (a) as the result of composition of <m>g</m> and <m>h</m>?  If so, in what order should <m>g</m> and <m>h</m> be composed in order to produce <m>f</m>?

Be sure to label the point on each of <m>k</m>, <m>j</m>, and <m>m</m> that corresponds to <m>(-2,-3)</m> on the original graph of <m>r</m>.
