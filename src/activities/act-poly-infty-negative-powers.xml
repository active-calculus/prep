			Point your browser to the <em>Desmos</em> worksheet at
      		<url href="http://gvsu.edu/s/0zv">http://gvsu.edu/s/0zv</url>.
      		In what follows, we explore the behavior of power functions <m>y = x^n</m> where <m>n \le -1</m>.

	      <ol label="a.">
	        <li>
	          <p>
	            Press the <q>play</q> button next to the slider labeled <q><m>n</m>.</q>
	            Watch two loops of the animation and then discuss the trends that you observe.
		            Write a careful sentence each for at least two different trends.
	          </p>
	        </li>

	        <li>
	          <p>
	            Click the icons next to each of the following 8 functions so that you can see all of <m>y = x^{-1}</m>,
	            <m>y = x^{-2}</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
	            <m>y = x^{-8}</m> graphed at once.
	            On the interval <m>1 \lt x</m>, how do the functions
	            <m>x^a</m> and <m>x^b</m> compare if <m>a \lt b</m>? (Be careful with negative numbers here:
	            e.g., <m>-3 \lt -2</m>.)
	          </p>
	        </li>

	        <li>

	        <li>
	          <p>
	            Uncheck the icons on each of the 8 functions to hide their graphs.
	            Click the settings icon to change the domain settings for the axes,
	            and change them to <m>-10 \le x \le 10</m> and <m>-10,000 \le y \le 10,000</m>.
	            Play the animation through twice and then discuss the trends that you observe.
