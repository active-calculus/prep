	<statement>
		<p>
		      In what follows,
      		  we work to understand two different piecewise functions entirely by hand based on familiar properties of linear and quadratic functions.
		</p>

		<p>
			<ol label="a.">
				<li>
					<p>
						Consider the function <m>p</m> defined by the following rule:
					      <me>
					        p(x) = 
					        \begin{cases}
					        	-(x+2)^2 + 2, \amp  x \lt  0 \\
					        	\frac{1}{2}(x-2)^2 + 1, \amp  x \ge 0
					        \end{cases}
					      </me>

					    What are the values of <m>p(-4)</m>, <m>p(-2)</m>, <m>p(0)</m>, <m>p(2)</m>, and <m>p(4)</m>?  
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						What point is the vertex of the quadratic part of <m>p</m> that is valid for <m>x \lt 0</m>?  What point is the vertex of the quadratic part of <m>p</m> that is valid for <m>x \ge 0</m>? 
					</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<p>
						For what values of <m>x</m> is <m>p(x) = 0</m>?  In addition, what is the <m>y</m>-intercept of <m>p</m>?
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Sketch an accurate, labeled graph of <m>y = p(x)</m> on the axes provided in <xref ref="F-combining-act-piecewise-axes">Figure</xref>.
					</p>

					<sidebyside width="50%">
						<figure xml:id="F-combining-act-piecewise-axes">
							<caption>Axes to plot <m>y = p(x)</m>.</caption>
							<image source="images/functions-y-x-blank-axes-centered-2"/>
						</figure>
						<figure xml:id="F-combining-act-piecewise-graph">
							<caption>Graph of <m>y = f(x)</m>.</caption>
							<image source="images/combining-act-f"/>
						</figure>
					</sidebyside>

				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						For the function <m>f</m> defined by <xref ref="F-combining-act-piecewise-graph">Figure</xref>, determine a piecewise-defined formula for <m>f</m> that is expressed in bracket notation similar to the definition of <m>y = p(x)</m> above.
