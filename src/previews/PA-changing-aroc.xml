      Let the height function for a ball tossed vertically be given by <m>s(t) = 64 - 16(t-1)^2</m>,
      where <m>t</m> is measured in seconds and <m>s</m> is measured in feet above the ground.

            What are the units on the quantity <m>AV_{[1.5,2.5]}</m>?

            In <em>Desmos</em>, plot the function
            <m>s(t) = 64 - 16(t-1)^2</m> along with the points
            <m>(1.5,s(1.5))</m> and <m>(2.5, s(2.5))</m>.
            Make a copy of your plot on the axes below,
            labeling key points as well as the scale on your axes.
            What is the domain of the model?
            The range?
            Why?
