    <title>Our Goals</title>
    <p>
      This text is designed for college students who aspire to take calculus and who either need to take a course to prepare them for calculus or want to do some additional self-study.  Many of the core topics of the course will be familiar to students who have completed high school.  At the same time, we take a perspective on every topic that emphasizes how it is important in calculus.  This text is  written in the spirit of <url href="https://activecalculus.org/single/"><em>Active Calculus</em></url> and is especially ideal for students who will eventually study calculus from that text.  The reader will find that the text requires them to engage actively with the material, to view topics from multiple perspectives, and to develop deep conceptual undersanding of ideas.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many courses at the high school and college level with titles such as <q>college algebra</q>, <q>precalculus</q>, and <q>trigonometry</q> serve other disciplines and courses other than calculus.  As such, these prerequisite classes frequently contain wide-ranging material that, while mathematically interesting and important, isn't necessary for calculus.  Perhaps because of these additional topics, certain ideas that are essential in calculus are under-emphasized or ignored.  In <pubtitle>Active Prelude to Calculus</pubtitle>, one of our top goals is to keep the focus narrow on the following most important ideas.  
    </p>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Functions as processes</em>.  The mathematical concept of function is sophisticated.  Understanding how a function is a special mathematical process that converts a collection of inputs to a collection of outputs is crucial for success in calculus, as calculus is the study of how functions change.
          </p> 
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Average rate of change</em>.  The central idea in differential calculus is the instantaneous rate of change of a function, which measures how fast a function's output changes with respect to changes in the input at a particular location.  Because instantaneous rate of change is defined in terms of average rate of change, it's essential that students are comfortable and familiar with the idea, meaning, and applications of average rate of change.
          </p>
        </li>        
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Library of basic functions</em>.  The vast majority of functions in calculus come from an algebraic combination of a collection of familiar basic functions that include power, circular, exponential, and logarithmic functions.  By developing understanding of a relatively small family of basic functions and using these along with transformations to consider larger collections of functions, we work to make the central objects of calculus more intuitive and accessible. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Families of functions that model important phenomena</em>.  Mathematics is the language of science, and it's remarkable how effective mathematics is at representing observable physical phenomena.  From quadratic functions that model how an object falls under the influence of gravity, to shifted exponential functions that model how coffee cools, to sinusoidal functions that model how a spring-mass system oscillates, familiar basic functions find many important applications in the world around us.  We regularly use these physical situations to help us see the importance of functions and to understand how families of functions that depend on different parameters are needed to represent these situations.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>The sine and cosine are circular functions</em>.  Many students are first introduced to the sine and cosine functions through right triangles.  While this perspective is important, it is more important in calculus and other advanced courses to understand how the sine and cosine functions arise from a point traversing a circle.  We take this circular function perspective early and first, and do so in order to develop deep understanding of how the familiar sine and cosine waves are generated.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Inverses of functions</em>.  When a function has an inverse function, the inverse function affords us the opportunity to view an idea from a new perspective.  Inverses also play a crucial role in solving algebraic equations and in determining unknown parameters in models.  We emphasize the perspective that an inverse function is a process that reverses the process of the original function, as well as important basic functions that arise as inverses of other functions, especially logarithms and inverse trigonometric functions.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Exact values versus approximate ones</em>.  The ability to represent numbers exactly is a powerful tool in mathematics.  We regularly and consistently distinguish between a number's exact value, such as <m>\sqrt{2}</m>, and its approximation, say <m>1.414</m>.  This idea is also closely tied to functions and function notation:  <m>e^{-1}</m>, <m>\cos(2)</m>, and <m>\ln(7)</m> are all symbolic representations of exact numbers that can only be approximated by a computer.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Finding function formulas in applied settings</em>.  In applied settings with unknown variables, it's especially useful to be able to represent relationships among variables, since such relationships often lead to functions whose behavior we can study.  We work throughout <em>Active Prelude to Calculus</em> to ready students for problems in calculus that ask them to develop function formulas by observing relationships.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Long-term trends, unbounded behavior, and limits</em>.  By working to study functions as objects themselves, we often focus on trends and overall behavior.  In addition to introducing the ideas of a function being increasing or decreasing, or concave up or concave down, we also focus on using algebraic approaces to comprehend function behavior where the input and/or output increase without bound.  In anticipation of calculus, we use limit notation and work to understand how this shorthand summarizes key features of functions.

    <title>Features of the Text</title>
    <p>
      Instructors and students alike will find several consistent features in the presentation,
      including:
      <dl width="narrow">
        <li>
          <title>Motivating Questions</title>
          <p>
            At the start of each section,
            we list 2<ndash />3 <em>motivating questions</em>
            that provide motivation for why the following material is of interest to us.
            One goal of each section is to answer each of the motivating questions.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <title>Preview Activities</title>
          <p>
            Each section of the text begins with a short introduction,
            followed by a <em>preview activity</em>.
            This brief reading and preview activity are designed to foreshadow the upcoming ideas in the remainder of the section;
            both the reading and preview activity are intended to be accessible to students
            <em>in advance</em> of class,
            and indeed to be completed by students before the particular section is to be considered
            in class.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <title>Activities</title>
          <p>
            A typical section in the text has at least three <em>activities</em>.
            These are designed to engage students in an inquiry-based style that encourages them to construct solutions to key examples on their own,
            working in small groups or individually.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <title>Exercises</title>
          <p>
            There are dozens of college algebra and trignometry texts with (collectively) tens of thousands of exercises.
            Rather than repeat standard and routine exercises in this text,
            we recommend the use of
            <webwork />
            with its access to the Open Problem Library (OPL) and many thousands of relevant problems.
            In this text,
            each section includes a small collection of anonymous <webwork /> exercises that offer
            students immediate feedback without penalty,
            as well as 3<ndash />4 additional challenging exercises per section.
            Each of the non-<webwork /> exercises has multiple parts,
            requires the student to connect several key ideas,
            and expects that the student will do at least a modest amount of writing to answer the questions and explain their findings.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <title>Graphics</title>
          <p>
            As much as possible,
            we strive to demonstrate key fundamental ideas visually,
            and to encourage students to do the same.
            Throughout the text, we use full-color<fn>To keep cost low,
            the graphics in the print-on-demand version are in black and white.
            When the text itself refers to color in images,
            one needs to view the .html or .pdf electronically.</fn> graphics to exemplify and magnify key ideas,
            and to use this graphical perspective alongside both numerical and algebraic representations of calculus.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <title>Interactive graphics</title>
          <p>
            Many of the ideas of how functions behave are best understood dynamically;
            applets offer an often ideal format for investigations and demonstrations.
            <em>Desmos</em> provides a free and easy-to-use online graphing utility that we occasionally link to and often direct students to use.  Thanks to David Austin, there are also select interactive javascript figures within the text itself.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <title>Summary of Key Ideas</title>
          <p>
            Each section concludes with a summary of the key ideas encountered in the preceding section;
            this summary normally reflects responses to the motivating questions that began the section.

    <title>Students!  Read this!</title>
    <p>
      This book is different.  
    </p>  

    <p>
      The text is available in three different formats:  HTML, PDF, and print, each of which is available via links on the landing page at <url href="https://activecalculus.org/">https://activecalculus.org/</url>.  The first two formats are free.  If you are going to use the book electronically, the best mode is the <url href="https://activecalculus.org/prelude/">HTML</url>.  The HTML version looks great in any browser, including on a smartphone, and the links are much easier to navigate in HTML than in PDF.  Some particular direct suggestions about using the HTML follow among the next few paragraphs; alternatively, you can <url href="http://gvsu.edu/s/14i">watch this short video from the author</url> (based on using the text <pubtitle>Active Calculus</pubtitle>, which is similar).  It is also wise to download and save the PDF, since you can use the PDF offline, while the HTML version requires an internet connection.  An inexpensive print copy is available on <url href="http://gvsu.edu/s/15y">Amazon</url>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This book is intended to be read sequentially and engaged with, much more than to be used as a lookup reference.  For example, each section begins with a short introduction and a Preview Activity; you should read the short introduction and complete the Preview Activity prior to class.  Your instructor may require you to do this.  Most Preview Activities can be completed in 15-20 minutes and are intended to be accessible based on the understanding you have from preceding sections. <!-- There are not answers provided to Preview Activities because ... -->    
    </p>

    <p>
      As you use the book, think of it as a workbook, not a worked-book.  There is a great deal of scholarship that shows people learn better when they interactively engage and struggle with ideas themselves, rather than passively watch others.  Thus, instead of reading worked examples or watching an instructor complete examples, you will engage with Activities that prompt you to grapple with concepts and develop deep understanding.  You should expect to spend time in class working with peers on Activities and getting feedback from them and from your instructor.  You can ask your instructor for a copy of the PDF file that has only the activities along with room to record your work.  Your goal should be to do all of the activities in the relevant sections of the text and keep a careful record of your work.  <!-- You can find answers to the activities <xref ref="activities-answers">in the back matter</xref>.-->
    </p>

    <p>
      Each section concludes with a Summary.  Reading the Summary after you have read the section and worked the Activities is a good way to find a short list of key ideas that are most essential to take from the section.  A good study habit is to write similar summaries in your own words.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the end of each section, you'll find two types of Exercises.  First, there are several anonymous <webwork /> exercises.  These are online, interactive exercises that allow you to submit answers for immediate feedback with unlimited attempts without penalty; to submit answers, you have to be using the HTML version of the text (see <url href="http://gvsu.edu/s/14i">this short video on the HTML version that includes a <webwork /> demonstration</url>).  You should use these exercises as a way to test your understanding of basic ideas in the preceding section.  If your institution uses <webwork />, you may also need to log in to a server as directed by your instructor to complete assigned <webwork /> sets as part of your course grade.  The <webwork /> exercises included in this text are ungraded and not connected to any individual account.  Following the <webwork /> exercises there are 3-4 additional challenging exercises that are designed to encourage you to connect ideas, investigate new situations, and write about your understanding. <!-- There are answers to most of the non-<webwork /> exercises <xref ref="exercises-answers">in the back matter</xref>.-->
    </p>

<!--
    <p>
      You can find additional support for your work in learning calculus from the <url href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9bIjQJDwfGuXQHuS5Jkmum_CFILoCZX-">GVSU Math 201 YouTube  Channel</url> and <url href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9bIjQJDwfGtewW75Nw7PnGNSkfqwAm3v">GVSU Math 202 YouTube Channel</url> where there are several short video tutorials for each section of the text, numbered in alignment with the textbook sections.  Math 201 corresponds to Chapters 1-4 and Math 202 to Chapters 5-8; there are about 90 videos for each, totally more than 180.
    </p>

    <p>
      The best way to be successful in mathematics generally and calculus specifically is to strive to make sense of the main ideas.  We make sense of ideas by asking questions, interacting with others, attempting to solve problems, making mistakes, revising attempts, and writing and speaking about our understanding.  This text has been designed to help you make sense of key ideas that are needed in calculus and to help you be well-prepared for success in calculus; we wish you the very best as you undertake the large and challenging task of doing so.

      This book is different.  Before you read further, first read <xref ref="preface-for-students" text="custom"><q>Students! Read this!</q></xref> as well as <xref ref="preface-our-goals" text="custom"><q>Our Goals</q></xref>.

      Among the three formats (HTML, PDF, print), the HTML is optimal for display in class if you have a suitable projector.  The HTML is also best for navigation, as links to internal and external references are much more obvious.  We recommend saving a downloaded version of the PDF format as a backup in the event you don't have internet access.  It's a good idea for each student to have a printed version of the Activities Workbook, which you can acquire as a PDF document by direct request to the author (boelkinm at gvsu dot edu); many instructors use the PDF to have coursepacks printed for students to purchase from their local bookstore.
    </p>

    <p>
      The text is written so that, on average, one section corresponds to two hours of class meeting time.  A typical instructional sequence when starting a new section might look like the following:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
             Students complete a Preview Activity in advance of class.  Class begins with a short debrief among peers followed by all class discussion.  (5-10 minutes) 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
             Brief lecture and discussion to build on the preview activity and set the stage for the next activity. (5-10 minutes) 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
             Students engage with peers to work on and discuss the first activity in the section. (15-20 minutes) 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
             Brief discussion and possibly lecture to reach closure on the preceding activity, followed by transition to new ideas.  (Varies, but 5-15 minutes)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Possibly begin next activity.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      The next hour of class would be similar, but without the Preview Activity to complete prior to class: the principal focus of class will be completing 2 activities.  Then rinse and repeat.
    </p>

    <p>
      We recommend that instructors use appropriate incentives to encourage students to complete Preview Activities prior to class.  Having these be part of completion-based assignments that count 5% of the semester grade usually results in the vast majority of students completing the vast majority of the previews.  If you'd like to see a sample syllabus for how to organize a course and weight various assignments, you can request one via email to the author.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that the <webwork /> exercises in the HTML version are anonymous and there's not a way to track students' engagement with them.  These are intended to be formative for students and provide them with immediate feedback without penalty.  If your institution is a <webwork /> user, in the near future we will have sets of .def files that correspond to the sections in the text; these will be available upon request to the author.
