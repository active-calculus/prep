    <introduction>
      <p>
		Recall that <m>F = g(C) = \frac{9}{5}C + 32</m> is the function that takes Celsius temperature inputs and produces the corresponding Fahrenheit temperature outputs.
	</p>
      <p/>
    </introduction>
    <task workspace="3cm" xml:id="PA-changing-inverse-F-C-task-0">
      <statement>
        <p>
					Show that it is possible to solve the equation <m>F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32</m> for <m>C</m> in terms of <m>F</m> and that doing so results in the equation <m>C = \frac{5}{9}(F-32)</m>.

    <task workspace="3cm" xml:id="PA-changing-inverse-F-C-task-1">
      <statement>
        <p>
					Note that the equation <m>C = \frac{5}{9}(F-32)</m> expresses <m>C</m> as a function of <m>F</m>.  Call this function <m>h</m> so that <m>C = h(F) = \frac{5}{9}(F-32)</m>.
				</p>
        <p>
					Find the simplest expression that you can for the composite function <m>j(C) = h(g(C))</m>.

      <statement>
        <p>
					Why are the functions <m>j</m> and <m>k</m> so simple?  Explain by discussing how the functions <m>g</m> and <m>h</m> process inputs to generate outputs and what happens when we first execute one followed by the other.
