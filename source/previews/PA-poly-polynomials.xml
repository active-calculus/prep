			Point your browser to the <em>Desmos</em> worksheet at <url href="http://gvsu.edu/s/0zy">http://gvsu.edu/s/0zy</url>.  There you'll find a degree <m>4</m> polynomial of the form <m>p(x) = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + a_3x^3 + a_4x^4</m>, where <m>a_0, \ldots, a_4</m> are set up as sliders.  In the questions that follow, you'll experiment with different values of <m>a_0, \ldots, a_4</m> to investigate different possible behaviors in a degree <m>4</m> polynomial.  Note that we require <m>a_4 \ne 0</m> in order to ensure <m>p</m> is a degree <m>4</m> polynomial.
