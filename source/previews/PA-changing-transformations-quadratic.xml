			Open a new <em>Desmos</em> graph and define the function <m>f(x) = x^2</m>.
            Adjust the window so that the range is for <m>-4 \le x \le 4</m> and <m>-10 \le y \le 10</m>.

						In <em>Desmos</em>,
            			define the function <m>g(x) = f(x) + a</m>. (That is,
            			in <em>Desmos</em> on line 2, enter
            			<c>g(x) = f(x) + a</c>.) You will get prompted to add a slider for <m>a</m>.
            			Do so.

        <p>
						Explore by moving the slider for <m>a</m> and write at least one sentence to describe

            			In particular, when <m>c = -1</m>,

						Finally, click on the icons next to <m>g</m>, <m>h</m>, and <m>p</m> to temporarily hide them, and go back to Line 1 and change your formula for <m>f</m>.
            			You can make it whatever you'd like,
            			but try something like <m>f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 3</m> or <m>f(x) = x^3 - 1</m>.
            			Then, investigate with the sliders <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>,
            			and <m>c</m> to see the effects on <m>g</m>, <m>h</m>, and <m>p</m> (unhiding them appropriately).
            			Write a couple of sentences to describe your observations of your explorations.
