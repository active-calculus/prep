      <p>
			Suppose that at age <m>20</m> you have $<m>20000</m> and you can choose between one of two ways to use the money:  you can invest it in a mutual fund that will, on average, earn <m>8</m>% interest annually, or you can purchase a new automobile that will, on average, depreciate <m>12</m>% annually.  Let's explore how the $<m>20000</m> changes over time.
		</p>
      <p>
			Let <m>I(t)</m> denote the value of the $<m>20000</m> after <m>t</m> years if it is invested in the mutual fund, and let <m>V(t)</m> denote the value of the automobile <m>t</m> years after it is purchased.
