      <p>
			In the context of the ferris wheel pictured in <xref ref="F-traversing-ferris-wheel-animation">Figure</xref>, assume that the height, <m>h</m>, of the moving point (the cab in which you are riding), and the distance, <m>d</m>, that the point has traveled around the circumference of the ferris wheel are both measured in meters.  
		</p>
      <p>	
			Further, assume that the circumference of the ferris wheel is <m>150</m> meters.  In addition, suppose that after getting in your cab at the lowest point on the wheel, you traverse the full circle several times.
