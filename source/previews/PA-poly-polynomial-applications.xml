			A piece of cardboard that is <m>12 \times 18</m> (each measured in inches) is being made into a box without a top.  To do so, squares are cut from each corner of the cardboard and the remaining sides are folded up.
		</p>

			<ol marker="a.">
				<li>
					<p>
						Let <m>x</m> be the side length of the squares being cut from the corners of the cardboard.  Draw a labeled diagram that shows the given information and the variable being used.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Determine a formula for the function <m>V</m> whose output is the volume of the box that results from a square of size <m>x \times x</m> being cut from each corner of the cardboard.

						What familiar kind of function is <m>V</m>?

				<li>
					<p>
						If we start with a small positive value for <m>x</m> and let that value get larger and larger, what is the first value of <m>x</m>we encounter that makes it impossible to remove <m>x \times x</m> squares from the cardboard and still form a box?

						What are the zeros of <m>V</m>?  What is the domain of the model <m>V</m> in the context of the rectangular box?
