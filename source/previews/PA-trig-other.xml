    <statement>
      <p>
			Consider a right triangle with hypotenuse of length <m>61</m> and one leg of length <m>11</m>.
      		Let <m>\alpha</m> be the angle opposite the side of length <m>11</m>.
      		Find the exact length of the other leg and then determine the value of each of the six trigonometric functions evaluated at <m>\alpha</m>.
      		In addition, what are the exact and approximate measures of the two non-right angles in the triangle?
