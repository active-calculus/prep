			In <xref ref="F-PA-big-unit-circle">Figure</xref> there are 24 equally spaced points on the unit circle.  Since the circumference of the unit circle is <m>2\pi</m>, each of the points is <m>\frac{1}{24} \cdot 2\pi = \frac{\pi}{12}</m> units apart (traveled along the circle). Thus, 
    		the first point counterclockwise from <m>(1,0)</m> corresponds to the distance
    		<m>t = \frac{\pi}{12}</m> traveled along the unit circle.  The second point is twice as far, and thus <m>t = 2 \cdot \frac{\pi}{12} = \frac{\pi}{6}</m> units along the circle away from <m>(1,0)</m>.

								One way to measure angles is connected to the arc length along a circle.  For an angle whose vertex is at <m>(0,0)</m> in the unit circle, we say the angle's measure is <term><m>1</m> radian</term><idx><h>radian</h></idx> provided that the angle intercepts an arc of the circle that is <m>1</m> unit in length, as pictured in <xref ref="F-PA-unit-circle-defining-radian">Figure</xref>.  Note particularly that an angle measuring <m>1</m> radian intercepts an arc of the same length as the circle's radius.
