			A drug company<fn>This activity is based on p. 457ff in <em>Functions Modeling Change</em>, by Connally et al.</fn> estimates that to produce a new drug,
			it will cost $5 million in startup resources, and that once they reach production, each gram of the drug will cost $2500 to make.

						The drug company needs to sell the drug at a price of more than $2500 per gram in order to at least break even.  To investigate how they might set prices, they first consider what their <em>average</em> cost per gram is.  What is the <em>total</em> cost of producing <m>1000</m> grams?  What is the <em>average</em> cost per gram to produce <m>1000</m> grams?
