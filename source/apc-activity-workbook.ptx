        <p>
          This Activities Workbook for <pubtitle>Active Prelude to Calculus</pubtitle> collects all the Preview Activities and Activities in a way that each starts on a new page.
          The Activities Workbook is designed to be used by students who wish to have a complete set of the activities to work through as they read the book in an electronic format and for instructors who wish to have a one activity per page format to make printing for distribution in class easier.
        </p>

        <p>
          The design of this workbook is such that each Preview Activity and Activity starts on a right-hand page.
          As a result,
          most left-hand pages in this workbook are intentionally left blank as a place for student work associated with one of the adjacent activities.
