    <introduction>

			Suppose that we want to construct a cylindrical can using <m>60</m> square inches of material for the surface of the can.  In this context, how does the can's volume depend on the radius we choose?
		</p>
      <p>
			Let the cylindrical can have base radius <m>r</m> and height <m>h</m>.

      <statement>
        <p>
						Use the formula for the surface area of a cylinder and the given constraint that the can's surface area is <m>60</m> square inches to write an equation that connects the radius <m>r</m> and height <m>h</m>.

						What is the domain of the function <m>V</m> in the context of the physical setting of this problem?  (Hint: how does the constraint on surface area provide an upper bound for the value of <m>r</m>?  Think about the maximum area that can be allocated to the top and bottom of the can.)
