	<statement>
		<p>
			Consider a tank in the shape of an inverted circular cone (point down) where the tank's radius is <m>2</m> feet and its depth is <m>4</m> feet.  Suppose that the tank is being filled with water that is entering at a constant rate of <m>0.75</m> cubic feet per minute.
		</p>

		<p>
			<ol marker="a.">
				<li>
					<p>
						Sketch a labeled picture of the tank, including a snapshot of there being water in the tank prior to the tank being completely full.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						What are some quantities that are changing in this scenario?  What are some quantities that are not changing?
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Fill in the following table of values to determine how much water, <m>V</m>, is in the tank at a given time in minutes, <m>t</m>, and thus generate a graph of the relationship between volume and time by plotting the data on the provided axes.

				<li>
					<p>
						Finally, think about how the height, <m>h</m>, of the water changes in tandem with time.  Without attempting to determine specific values of <m>h</m> at particular values of <m>t</m>, how would you expect the data for the relationship between <m>h</m> and <m>t</m> to appear?  Use the provided axes to sketch at least two possibilities; write at least one sentence to explain how you think the graph should appear.
