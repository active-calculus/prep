      <p>
			Consider a tank in the shape of an inverted circular cone (point down) where the tank's radius is <m>2</m> feet and its depth is <m>4</m> feet.  Suppose that the tank is being filled with water that is entering at a constant rate of <m>0.75</m> cubic feet per minute.

						Finally, think about how the height, <m>h</m>, of the water changes in tandem with time.  Without attempting to determine specific values of <m>h</m> at particular values of <m>t</m>, how would you expect the data for the relationship between <m>h</m> and <m>t</m> to appear?  Use the provided axes to sketch at least two possibilities; write at least one sentence to explain how you think the graph should appear.
