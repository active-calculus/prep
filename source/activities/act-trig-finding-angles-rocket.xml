    <statement>
      <p>
	      A camera is tracking the launch of a SpaceX rocket.
	      The camera is located <m>4000</m>' from the rocket's launching pad,
	      and the camera angle changes in order to keep the rocket in focus.
	      At what angle <m>\theta</m>
	      (in radians)
	      is the camera tilted when the rocket is <m>3000</m>' off the ground?
	      Answer both exactly and approximately.
	    </p>
      <p>
	      Now, rather than considering the rocket at a fixed height of <m>3000</m>', let its height vary and call the rocket's height <m>h</m>.
	      Determine the camera's angle,
	      <m>\theta</m> as a function of <m>h</m>,
	      and compute the average rate of change of <m>\theta</m> on the intervals <m>[3000,3500]</m>,
	      <m>[5000,5500]</m>, and <m>[7000,7500]</m>.
	      What do you observe about how the camera angle is changing?
