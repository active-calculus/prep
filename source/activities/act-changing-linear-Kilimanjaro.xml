	      The summit of Africa's largest peak, Mt.
	      Kilimanjaro<fn>
	      The main context of this problem comes from Exercise 30 on p.<nbsp/>27 of Connally's
	      <em>Functions Modeling Change</em>, 5th ed.
	      </fn>, has two main ice fields and a glacier at its peak.
	      Geologists measured the ice cover in the year 2000 (<m>t = 0</m>) to be approximately <m>1951</m> m<m>^2</m>;
	      in the year 2007, the ice cover measured <m>1555</m> m<m>^2</m>.

        <p>
	            Suppose that the amount of ice cover at the peak of Mt.
	            Kilimanjaro is changing at a constant average rate from year to year.
	            Find a linear model <m>A = f(t)</m> whose output is the area of the ice cover,
	            <m>A</m>,
	            in square meters in year <m>t</m>
	            (where <m>t</m> is the number of years after 2000).
