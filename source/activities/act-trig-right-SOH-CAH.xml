	<statement>
		<p>
			In each of the following scenarios involving a right triangle, determine the exact values of as many of the remaining side lengths and angle measures (in radians) that you can.  If there are quantities that you cannot determine, explain why.  For every prompt, draw a labeled diagram of the situation.
