    <statement>
      <p>
	      Consider a spring-mass system where the weight is hanging from the ceiling in such a way that the following is known:
	      we let <m>d(t)</m> denote the distance from the ceiling to the weight at time <m>t</m> in seconds and know that the weight oscillates periodically with a minimum value of
	      <m>1.5</m> feet and a maximum value of <m>4</m> feet,
	      with a period of <m>3</m>,
	      and you know <m>d(0.5) = 2.75</m> and <m>d\left(1.25\right) = 4</m>.
	    </p>
      <p>
	      State the midline, amplitude, range, and an anchor point for the function, and hence determine a formula for <m>d(t)</m> in the form <m>a\cos(k(t-b))+c</m> or <m>a\sin(k(t-b))+c</m>.
	      Show your work and thinking,
	      and use <em>Desmos</em> appropriately to check that your formula generates the desired behavior.
