	<statement>
		<p>
			Consider a spring-mass system where a weight is resting on a frictionless table.  We let <m>d(t)</m> denote the distance from the wall (where the spring is attached) to the weight at time <m>t</m> in seconds and know that the weight oscillates periodically with a minimum value of <m>2</m> feet and a maximum value of <m>7</m> feet with a period of <m>2 \pi</m>.  We also know that <m>d(0) = 4.5</m> and <m>d\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = 2</m>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Determine a formula for <m>d(t)</m> in the form <m>d(t) = a\cos(t-b)+c</m> or <m>d(t) = a\sin(t-b)+c</m>.  Is it possible to find two different formulas that work?  For any formula you find, identify the anchor point.
