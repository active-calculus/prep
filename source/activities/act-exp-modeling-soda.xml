    <introduction>
      <p>
			A can of soda (at room temperature) is placed in a refrigerator at time <m>t = 0</m> (in minutes)
      		and its temperature, <m>F(t)</m>, in degrees Fahrenheit, is computed at regular intervals.
			Based on the data, a model is formulated for the object's temperature, given by
		      <me>
		        F(t) = 42 + 30(0.95)^{t}
		      </me>.

      <statement>
        <p>
						Consider the simpler (parent) function <m>p(t) = (0.95)^t</m>.
            			How do you expect the graph of this function to appear?
            			How will it behave as time increases?
            			Without using graphing technology,
            			sketch a rough graph of <m>p</m> and write a sentence of explanation.

						For the slightly more complicated function <m>r(t) = 30 (0.95)^{t}</m>, how do you expect this function to look in comparison to <m>p</m>?  What is the long-range behavior of this function as <m>t</m> increases?

								Finally, how do you expect the graph of <m>F(t) = 42 + 30(0.95)^{t}</m> to appear?
            					Why?  First sketch a rough graph without graphing technology, and then use technology to check your thinking
            					and report an accurate, labeled graph on the axes provided in <xref ref="F-modeling-act-blank-axes-soda">Figure</xref>.
