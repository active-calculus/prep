			During a major rainstorm, the rainfall at Gerald R. Ford Airport is measured on a frequent basis for a <m>10</m>-hour period of time.  The following function <m>g</m> models the <em>rate</em>, <m>R</m>, at which the rain falls (in cm/hr) on the time interval <m>t = 0</m> to <m>t = 10</m>:
			<me>
				R = g(t) = \frac{4}{t+2} + 1

						Compute the average rate of change of <m>g</m> on the time interval <m>[3,5]</m> and write two careful complete sentences to explain the meaning of this value in the context of the problem, including units.  Explicitly address what the value you compute tells you about how rain is falling over a certain time interval, and what you should expect as time goes on.
