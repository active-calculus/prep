	      Let <m>f</m> be a function that measures a car's fuel economy in the following way.
	      Given an input velocity <m>v</m> in miles per hour,
	      <m>f(v)</m> is the number of gallons of fuel that the car consumes per mile (i.e., <q>gallons per mile</q>).
	      We know that <m>f(60) = 0.04</m>.
