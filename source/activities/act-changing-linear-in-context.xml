						A town's population initially has <m>28750</m> people present and then grows at a constant rate of <m>825</m> people per year.

						A different town's population <m>Q</m> is given by the function <m>Q = g(t) = 42505 - 465t</m>.  What is the slope of this function and what is its meaning in the model?  Write a complete sentence to explain.

						A spherical tank is being drained with a pump.  Initially the tank is full with <m>\frac{32\pi}{3}</m> cubic feet of water.  Assume the tank is drained at a constant rate of <m>1.2</m> cubic feet per minute.  Find a linear model <m>V = p(t)</m> for the total amount of water in the tank at time <m>t</m>.  In addition, what is a reasonable approximate domain for the model?

Assuming that the car's value depreciates linearly, find a  function <m>C = L(t)</m> whose output is the value of the car in year <m>t</m>.  What is a reasonable domain for the model?  What is the value and meaning of the slope of the line?  Write at least one careful sentence to explain.
