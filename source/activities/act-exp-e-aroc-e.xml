    <introduction>
      <p>
			Recall from <xref ref="sec-changing-aroc">Section</xref> that the average rate of change of a function <m>f</m> on an interval <m>[a,b]</m> is 
			<me>
				AV_{[a,b]} = \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}
			</me>.
			In <xref ref="sec-changing-composite">Section</xref>, we also saw that if we instead think of the average rate of change of <m>f</m> on the interval <m>[a,a+h]</m>, the expression changes to
			<me>
				AV_{[a,a+h]} = \frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}
			</me>.
			In this activity we explore the average rate of change of <m>f(t) = e^t</m> near the points where <m>t = 1</m> and <m>t = 2</m>.
		</p>
      <p>
			In a new <em>Desmos</em> worksheet, let <m>f(t) = e^t</m> and define the function <m>A</m> by the rule 
			<me>
				A(h) = \frac{f(1+h)-f(1)}{h}
			</me>.
