			The value of an automobile is depreciating.  When the car is <m>3</m> years old, its value is $<m>12500</m>; when the car is <m>7</m> years old, its value is $<m>6500</m>.

      <statement>
        <p>
						Suppose the car's value <m>t</m> years after its purchase is given by the function <m>V(t)</m> and that <m>V</m> is exponential with form <m>V(t) = ab^t</m>, what are the values of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>?  Find <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> both exactly and approximately.

						Using the exponential model determined in (a), determine the purchase value of the car and then use <em>Desmos</em>estimate when the car will be worth less than $<m>1000</m>.

						Suppose instead that the car's value is modeled by a linear function <m>L</m> and satisfies the values stated at the outset of this activity.  Find a formula for <m>L(t)</m> and determine both the purchase value of the car and when the car will be worth $<m>1000</m>.
