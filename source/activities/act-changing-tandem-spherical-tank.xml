    <introduction>
      <p>
			Consider a tank in the shape of a sphere where the tank's radius is <m>3</m> feet.  Suppose that the tank is initially completely full and that it is being drained by a pump at a constant rate of <m>1.2</m> cubic feet per minute.

						Finally, think about how the height of the water changes in tandem with time. What is the height of the water when <m>t = 0</m>?  What is the height when the tank is empty?  How would you expect the data for the relationship between <m>h</m> and <m>t</m> to appear?  Use the provided axes to sketch at least two possibilities; write at least one sentence to explain how you think the graph should appear.
