    <statement>
      <p>
			A roof is being built with a <q>7-12 pitch.</q>
		      This means that the roof rises <m>7</m> inches vertically for every <m>12</m> inches of horizontal span;
		      in other words, the slope of the roof is <m>\frac{7}{12}</m>.
		      What is the exact measure (in degrees)
		      of the angle the roof makes with the horizontal?
		      What is the approximate measure?
		      What are the exact and approximate measures of the angle at the peak of the roof (made by the front and back portions of the roof that meet to form the ridge)?
