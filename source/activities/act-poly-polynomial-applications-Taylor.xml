    <introduction>
      <p>
			We understand the theoretical rule behind the function <m>f(t) = \sin(t)</m>: given an angle <m>t</m> in radians, <m>\sin(t)</m> measures the value of the <m>y</m>-coordinate of the corresponding point on the unit circle.  For special values of <m>t</m>, we have determined the exact value of <m>\sin(t)</m>.  For example, <m>\sin(\frac{\pi}{3}) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}</m>.  But note that we don't have a <em>formula</em> for <m>\sin(t)</m>.  Instead, we use a button on our calculator or command on our computer to find values like <q><m>\sin(1.35)</m>.</q>  It turns out that a combination of calculus and polynomial functions explains how computers determine values of the sine function.

      <p>
			At <url href="http://gvsu.edu/s/0zA">http://gvsu.edu/s/0zA</url>, you'll find a <em>Desmos</em> worksheet that has the sine function already defined, along with a sequence of polynomials labeled <m>T_1(x)</m>, <m>T_3(x)</m>, <m>T_5(x)</m>, <m>T_7(x)</m>, <m>\ldots</m>.  You can see these functions' graphs by clicking on their respective icons.

						In a new <em>Desmos</em> worksheet, plot the function <m>y = \cos(x)</m> along with the following functions: <m>P_2(x) = 1 - \frac{x^2}{2!}</m> and <m>P_4(x) = 1 - \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!}</m>.
