		<p>
			Each of the following prompts describes a relationship between two quantities.  For each, your task is to decide whether or not the relationship can be thought of as a function.  If not, explain why.  If so, state the domain and codomain of the function and write at least one sentence to explain the process that leads from the collection of inputs to the collection of outputs.  
		</p>

					<p>
						The relationship between <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> in each of the graphs below (address each graph separately as a potential situation where <m>y</m> is a function of <m>x</m>).  In <xref ref="F-functions-act-is-it-1">Figure</xref>, any point on the circle relates <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.  For instance, the <m>y</m>-value <m>\sqrt{7}</m> is related to the <m>x</m>-value <m>-3</m>.  In <xref ref="F-functions-act-is-it-2">Figure</xref>, any point on the blue curve relates <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.  For instance, when <m>x = -1</m>, the corresponding <m>y</m>-value is <m>y = 3</m>.  An unfilled circle indicates that there is not a point on the graph at that specific location.

						The relationship between the day of the year and the value of the S&amp;P500 stock index (at the close of trading on a given day), where we attempt to consider the index's value (at the close of trading) as a function of the day of the year.
