			In the questions that follow, we compare and contrast the properties and behaviors of exponential and logarithmic functions.

      <statement>
        <p>
						Let <m>f(t) = 1 - e^{-(t-1)}</m> and <m>g(t) = \ln(t)</m>.  Plot each function on the same set of coordinate axes.  What properties do the two functions have in common?  For what properties do the two functions differ?  Consider each function's domain, range, <m>t</m>-intercept, <m>y</m>-intercept, increasing/decreasing behavior, concavity, and long-term behavior.

						Do you think this data is better modeled by a logarithmic function of form <m>p(t) = a + b\ln(t-c)</m> or by an exponential function of form <m>q(t) = m + ne^{-rt}</m>.  Provide reasons based in how the data appears and how you think a tree grows, as well as by experimenting with sliders appropriately in <em>Desmos</em>.  (Note: you may need to adjust the upper and lower bounds of several of the sliders in order to match the data well.)
