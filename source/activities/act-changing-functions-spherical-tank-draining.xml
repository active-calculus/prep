    <introduction>
      <p>
			Consider a spherical tank of radius <m>4</m> m that is completely full of water.  Suppose that the tank is being drained by regulating an exit valve in such a way that the height of the water in the tank is always decreasing at a rate of <m>0.5</m> meters per minute.  Let 
			<m>V</m> be the volume of water in the tank (in cubic meters) at a given time <m>t</m> (in minutes), and
			<m>h</m> the depth of the water (in meters) at the same time.  It can be shown using calculus 
			that <m>V</m> is a function of <m>t</m> according to the model
      		<me>
        		V = p(t) = \frac{256\pi}{3} - \frac{\pi}{24} t^2(24-t)
      		</me>.
      		In addition, let <m>h = q(t)</m> be the function whose output is the depth of the water in the tank at time <m>t</m>.

						We will frequently use a graphing utility to help us understand function behavior, and strongly recommend <url href="https://www.desmos.com/"><em>Desmos</em></url> because it is intuitive, online, and free.<fn>To learn more about <em>Desmos</em>, see their <url href="http://learn.desmos.com/">outstanding online tutorials</url>.</fn></p>

						In <url href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/btlyyxsdr4">this prepared <em>Desmos</em> worksheet</url>, you can see how we enter the (abstract) function <m>V = p(t) = \frac{256\pi}{3} - \frac{\pi}{24} t^2(24-t)</m>, as well as the corresponding graph the program generates.  Make as many observations as you can about the model <m>V = p(t)</m>.  You should discuss its shape and overall behavior, its domain, its range, and more.
