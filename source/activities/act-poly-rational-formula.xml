	<statement>
		<p>
			Find a formula for a rational function that meets the stated criteria as given by words, a sign chart, or graph.  Write several sentences to justify why your formula matches the specifications.  
		</p>

		<p>
			<ol marker="a.">
				<li>
					<p>
						A rational function <m>r</m> such that <m>r</m> has a vertical asymptote at <m>x = -2</m>, a zero at <m>x = 1</m>, a hole at <m>x = 5</m>, and a horizontal asymptote of <m>y = -3</m>.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						A rational function <m>u</m> whose numerator has degree <m>3</m>, denominator has degree <m>3</m>, and that has exactly one vertical asymptote at <m>x = -4</m> and a horizontal asymptote of <m>y = \frac{3}{7}</m>.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						A rational function <m>w</m> whose formula generates a graph with all of the characteristics shown in <xref ref="F-act-poly-rational-plot">Figure</xref>.  Assume that <m>w(5) = 0</m> but <m>w(x) \gt 0</m> for all other <m>x</m> such that <m>x \gt 3</m>.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						A rational function <m>z</m> whose formula satisfies the sign chart shown in <xref ref="F-act-poly-rational-sign-chart">Figure</xref>, and for which <m>z</m> has no horizontal asymptote and its only vertical asymptotes occur at the middle two values of <m>x</m> noted on the sign chart.
