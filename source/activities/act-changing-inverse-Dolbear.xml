    <introduction>
      <p>
			Recall Dolbear's function <m>F = D(N) = 40 + \frac{1}{4}N</m> that converts the number, <m>N</m>, of snowy tree cricket chirps per minute to a corresponding Fahrenheit temperature.  We have earlier established that the domain of <m>D</m> is <m>[40,180]</m> and the range of <m>D</m> is <m>[50,85]</m>, as seen in <xref ref="F-functions-Dolbear-data">Figure</xref>.

      <statement>
        <p>
						Solve the equation <m>F = 40 + \frac{1}{4}N</m> for <m>N</m> in terms of <m>F</m>.  Call the resulting function <m>N = E(F)</m>.

						Consider the equations <m>F = 40 + \frac{1}{4}N</m> and <m>N = 4(F-40)</m>.  Do these equations express different relationships between <m>F</m> and <m>N</m>, or do they express the same relationship in two different ways?  Explain.
