			Surveyors are trying to determine the height of a hill relative to sea level.  First, they choose a point to take an initial measurement with a sextant that shows the angle of elevation from the ground to the peak of the hill is <m>19^\circ</m>.  Next, they move <m>1000</m> feet closer to the hill, staying at the same elevation relative to sea level, and find that the angle of elevation has increased to <m>25^\circ</m>, as pictured in <xref ref="F-tan-act-mountain">Figure</xref>.  We let <m>h</m> represent the height of the hill relative to the two measurements, and <m>x</m> represent the distance from the second measurement location to the <q>center</q> of the hill that lies directly under the peak.
