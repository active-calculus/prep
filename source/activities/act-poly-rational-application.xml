    <introduction>
      <p>
			Suppose that we want to build an open rectangular box (that is, without a top) that holds <m>15</m> cubic feet of volume.  If we want one side of the base to be twice as long as the other, how does the amount of material required depend on the shorter side of the base?  We investigate this question through the following sequence of prompts.
